# Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

> Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy,
>  which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.


## What are CSRF tokens?

> A CSRF token is a unique, secret, unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and transmitted to the client in such a way that it is included in a subsequent HTTP request made by the client. When the later request is made, 
> the server-side application validates that the request includes the expected token and rejects the request if the token is missing or invalid.

***Puede ayudar a proteger contra XSS reflejados*** porque:

> CSRF tokens can prevent CSRF attacks by making it impossible for an attacker to construct a fully valid HTTP request suitable for feeding to a victim user. 
Since the attacker cannot determine or predict the value of a user's CSRF token, they cannot construct a request with all the parameters that are necessary for the application to honor the request.
